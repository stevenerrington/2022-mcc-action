% Look at RT adaptation following successful stopping
%   We approach this in two ways:
%       1. The median RT on no-stop trials following canceled, no-stop, and
%       non-canceled trials
%       2. The change in RT from a no-stop trial prior to a canceled trial,
%       to a no-stop trial following a canceled trial.
